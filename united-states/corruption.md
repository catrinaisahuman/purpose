The purpose of this file is to make a detailed list of corruptions and dishonesty within the United States government. And, if possible, to explain or show how it could have been resolved if the Triscea framework had been used.
NOTE: This list is not to try and make the case that Triscea is superior to other governments, but to give an idea of what Triscea needs to ensure it avoids the problems encountered by many major governments.

May - August 2019: Trump-Ukraine Controversy:

This occured when the 45th President of the USA, Donald Trump, pressed Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden, the democratic presidential candidate, and Biden's son, Hunter Biden. Trump refused to speak with the Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky unless they discussed Biden. During this time, Trump placed a hold on military aid to Ukraine, likely with the intent to pressure Zelensky into investigating Biden. This itself would be problematic, but this information was kept private, and attempts were made to make it much more difficult for anyone to access the record of these contacts.
